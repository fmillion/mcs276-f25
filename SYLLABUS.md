It is my sincere desire to ensure your success in this course. My personal E-mail policy is as follows: if you have sent me an E-mail with a question about anything related to this course, I will strive to answer you with a response *within 24 hours* (including weekends!). If you have sent me an E-mail with a question and I have not replied to you within 24 hours, **please feel free to resend your E-mail**. My response may be as simple as "I need some time to provide an answer", but I will *acknowledge* your E-mail within 24 hours. Faculty receive a lot of E-mail and have a lot of things on their plates, so it is easy for E-mails to be missed or get lost. Therefore, *please* do not hesitate to resend E-mails that you haven't gotten responses to - **I would rather get your email more than once than miss it entirely!**

## Overview

In this course, you will receive an introduction to computer systems as seen through the eye of a programmer. You'll learn how a computer executes programs, stores information, and communicates. You will become a more effective programmer, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. 

The course also serves as a foundation for MCS-376: Systems II, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. 

Topics covered include: 

* computer arithmetic
* machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers
* concurrent (multithreaded/parallel) computation
* networking technology and protocols
* performance evaluation and optimization

## Textbook

The textbook for this course is [Dive Into Systems by Suzanne Matthews et.al](https://diveintosystems.org/). This is a *free* textbook that you can read online in any web browser. You may choose to purchase a print copy of the book on your own but it is not required.

## Lab Assignments and Exams

This course will include three *major* lab projects and regular small homework assignments. Homework assignments can generally be completed within a few hours. Larger lab projects will require significant effort. I strongly recommend you study lab assignments when first given and ask any questions early, to give yourself enough time to complete the assignment on time. 

Homework assignments will often model exams, so homework should also be considered practice for the exam. 

There will be two exams - one at midterm, and a final exam. Exams will be open book/open notes, except you may not use artificial intelligence tools on exams. (More information on my AI usage policy is in the [Artificial Intelligence Policy](#artificial-intelligence-policy) section.)

## Attendance

Attendance is not specifically graded in this course. **However**, regular attendance to both classroom and online sessions is very important for your success, both in this course and beyond. Therefore, significantly poor attendance *will* have an overall impact on your final grade.

Generally, if you miss:

* up to three sessions: your grade won't be impacted - you can think of this as "three free absences".
* four (4) or more sessions: your total final grade will be lowered by 5%.
* six (6) or more sessions: your total final grade will be lowered by 10% (one whole letter grade)
* eight (8) sessions: your total final grade will be lowered by 20% (two whole letter grades)
* beyond 8 sessions: you will have to discuss your situation with me to determine the best course of action.

If you need to miss a class here and there, that's generally fine - remember that it is still *your responsibility* to keep up on homework, labs and exam preparation. You should regularly refer to the course GitHub and to Moodle for up-to-date information on course content, assignments, expectations and due dates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are aware of an upcoming situation that will prevent you from attending class, please *E-mail me* as soon as you are aware of the situation. I will consider extended excused absences (beyond three) on a case-by-case basis. 

## Grading

The course components will contribute to your grade in the following proportion:

* Homework: 15%
* Labs: 50%
* Midterm Test: 10%
* Final exam: 25%

I will use standard A-F grading as follows:

Percentage of Points | Grade
-------------------- | -----
93% | A
90% | A-
87% | B+
84% | B
80% | B-
77% | C+
74% | C
70% | C-
67% | D+
60% | D
0% | F

## Academic Honesty

All work that you submit must either be your own, original work, or you must cite sources for your work. 

Unless otherwise noted, you do not need to use any formal citation method - simply mentioning the source in code comments, in your homework document, etc. is acceptable. 

Submitting work that is not your own - regardless of the source - without citation constitutes academic dishonesty and will subject you to penalties, up to and including a grade of F and removal from the course and referral to the college.

**Certain homework or lab assignments may be specified as group assignments**. In these cases, you **are permitted** to share materials within your group, but you **may not** share materials with students outside your group.

I strongly support collaboration and I do expect that you will help your classmates where necessary. However, such help must not consist of giving a copy of your work to a fellow classmate or giving a specific solution to a problem. The work you submit must be entirely your own work, and you must be able to defend your work - for example, if you submit code, you should be able to answer questions someone might ask you about specific aspects or statements in your code.

Gustavus Adolphus College is proud to operate under an honor system (for more information, please see here). The faculty and students have jointly created an Honor Board to enforce the Honor Code and the Academic Honesty Policy. Each faculty member is responsible for stating course penalties for academic honesty violations, and for defining the level of authorized aid appropriate to the work in their courses. Each faculty member is also required to report violations of the Academic Honesty Policy to the Provost's Office. It is your responsibility, as a student, to ask questions if you are not sure about situations such as when to cite a source, how to cite a source, sharing data with lab-mates, and avoiding inadvertent cheating when working in groups. It is also your responsibility to learn about the policy and the consequences for violations so please ask questions!

### Artificial Intelligence Policy

For the most part, I treat code or other text generated with artificial intelligence the same way I treat materials obtained from a human-generated source (website post, book, classmate&hellip;). You *can* use AI as a tool to help you learn and as a reference (where permitted), but you *cannot* (and should not!) use AI as a tool to "do the work for you". In particular, copying code from AI and submitting it as your own constitutes academic dishonesty, just as if you had submitted a fellow classmate's work as your own.

As with any code you submit, you must **fully understand and be able to defend your code**. In any case, you may *not* share artifacts you generate with AI with any other classmates (with the obvious exception of sharing with your group members for group project work).

> [!CAUTION]
> Use of any artificial intelligence system during formal exams is **strictly prohibited**. During exams, you may **only** use your own notes and the textbook as reference.

I exercise common sense in enforcing these policies. For example, if you discover that there is one single well-established strategy for accomplishing a given generic task and a template implementing that method is provided, and coding an alternative strategy would be excessively awkward or would create other secondary issues (e.g. insecure code, slower performance, etc.), then using such a template is not considered "copying and pasting large amounts of code verbatim".

> To illustrate this, consider that many IDEs provide templates for various project types and also often offer "wizards" that generate parts of the code for you based on parameters you specify, with the generated code following established coding practices. 
> 
> Use of such tools is *not* violation of this policy, since they are generic in nature and you are still required to write the code to make the application perform your specific tasks.
>
> However, asking an AI engine to write code for your *specific, unique* scenario, and then copying that code as-is, is a violation of this policy.

If you have further questions on this policy, or want to ask about a specific scenario, please feel free to ask me.

## Academic Accommodations

Gustavus Adolphus College is committed to ensuring equitable and inclusive learning environments for all students. If you have a disability and anticipate or experience barriers to equal access, please speak with the accessibility resources staff about your needs. A disability may include mental health, attentional, learning, chronic health, sensory, physical, and/or short-term conditions. Students with a documented elevated risk of COVID-19 may also request academic accommodations. When appropriate, staff will guide students and professors in making accommodations to ensure equal access. Accommodations cannot be made retroactively; therefore, to maximize your academic success at Gustavus, please contact them as early as possible. Accessibility resources staff are located in the Academic Support Center (<https://gustavus.edu/asc/accessibility/>) (x7227). Accessibility Resources Coordinator, Corrie Odland ([codland@gustavus.edu](mailto:codland@gustavus.edu)), can provide further information.

## Multilingual Student Support

Some Gusties may have grown up speaking a language (or languages) other than English at home. If so, we refer to you as "multilingual."" Your multilingual background is an incredible resource for you, and for our campus, but it can come with some challenges. You can find support through the Center for International and Cultural Education's (<https://gustavus.edu/cice/>) Multilingual and Intercultural Program Coordinator (MIPC), Pamela Pearson (ppearson@gustavus.edu). Pamela can meet individually for tutoring in writing, consulting about specific assignments, and helping students connect with the College's support systems. If you want help with a specific task (for example, reading word problems on an exam quickly enough or revising grammar in essays), let your professor and Pamela know as soon as possible.

In addition, the Writing Center (https://gustavus.edu/writingcenter/) offers tutoring from peers (some of whom are themselves multilingual) who can help you do your best writing.

## Mental Wellbeing

The Gustavus community is committed to and cares about all students. Strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol or drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, and/or lack of motivation may affect a student's academic performance or reduce a student's ability to participate in daily activities. If you or someone you know expresses such mental health concerns or experiences a stressful event that can create barriers to learning, Gustavus services are available to assist you, and include online options. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential health services available on campus at <https://gustavus.edu/counseling/> and <https://gustavus.edu/deanofstudents/services/>.
